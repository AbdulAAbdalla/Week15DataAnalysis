Your promotion to Data Analyst is here! It is time to transform a dataset into insights using SQL and visualise your findings using charts like a data analyst pro. 



The Mission:

1. Data Dive (10 pts):

Pick your dataset and click to download (Social Media Users, Netflix Shows, or Human Stampedes).
Import it into MySQL Workbench (learn how!). 
Briefly explain any difficulties and 1 interesting thing you noticed about your chosen dataset.


2. Data Fun (20 pts):

Use simple SQL queries to play with the data.
Find 2 cool facts hidden within the data (e.g., most popular interests).
Use basic SQL queries like (COUNT, AVG, and SUM) to understand more about the data you have.


3. Ask Away (30 pts):

Formulate 2 questions about the data (e.g., what are popular shows in different countries?).
Write basic SQL queries (WHERE, ORDER BY) to find answers.
Share what you learned from the answers.


4. Showtime! (20 pts):

Use a tool (like Microsoft Excel charts) to create 3 charts showing your findings in the week 15 assignment.
Choose charts that clarify your discoveries using (bar charts, pie charts etc.).


5. Presentation Pitch Deck (20 pts):

Prepare a short pitch deck presentation to showcase your work:
Introduce the dataset and your goals.
Briefly explain the import process and the interesting thing you found.
Share the 2 cool facts you discovered.
Discuss your questions, SQL queries, and what you learned.
Present your charts and explain their meaning.
Briefly summarise your project.


6.GitHub Repository:

Grading:


Be creative! Think of different questions to ask about the data.
Make your presentation engaging and easy to understand.
